## 🗂️ Files Modified

### `app.js` - Main JavaScript Logic
- Added `showCustomDialog()` function for flexible dialog creation
- Added `showRestockModal()` function for restock operations  
- Added `removeStockPartial()` function for quantity-specific removal
- Added `removeStockCompletely()` function for full deletion
- Added `restockItem()` function for adding stock to existing items
- Enhanced `executeProtectedAction()` to handle new operation types

### `index.html` - UI Structure
- Added custom dialog modal (`#customDialog`)
- Added restock modal (`#restockModal`) 
- Password modal already existed and works with new operations

### `style.css` - Styling
- Modal styles already existed and work perfectly with new dialogs

### Backend Files
- Existing `removeStock.ts` mutation handles both partial and complete removal
- Existing `addStock.ts` mutation handles restocking operations
- No backend changes required - existing mutations are flexible enough

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Start the Development Environment
```bash
# Start Convex backend
npx convex dev

# Start local server (if using one)
# The app can also run directly from index.html
```

### 2. Navigate to Stock Management
- Open the application in your browser
- Go to the "Stock" tab
- View your current inventory

### 3. Manage Stock Items

#### For Items with Stock:
- **📉 Remove Some** - Opens quantity input dialog
  - Enter amount to remove (validates against available stock)
  - Requires owner password confirmation
  
- **🗑️ Delete All** - Opens confirmation dialog  
  - Completely removes item from inventory
  - Requires owner password confirmation

#### For Out-of-Stock Items:
- **🔄 Restock** - Opens restock modal
  - Enter quantity to add
  - Update price if needed
  - No password required (safe operation)
  
- **🗑️ Delete** - Removes empty stock record
  - Requires owner password confirmation

## 🔐 Security Features
- Owner password protection for all removal operations
- Input validation prevents invalid quantities
- Clear confirmation messages for destructive actions
- Non-destructive operations (restock) don't require passwords

## 🧪 Testing
Use the included `test-functions.js` to test dialog functionality:

```javascript
// In browser console:
testSimpleDialog()    // Test confirmation dialogs
testInputDialog()     // Test quantity input dialogs  
testRestockModal()    // Test restock functionality
```

## 💡 Benefits
1. **Better UX**: Professional modals instead of browser prompts
2. **Safer Operations**: Clear confirmations and validation
3. **Flexible Workflows**: Different options for different stock states
4. **Consistent Design**: Matches existing application styling
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive modal dialogs work on all devices

## 🔧 Technical Details
- Uses modern JavaScript async/await patterns
- Promise-based dialog system for clean code
- Integrates seamlessly with existing Convex mutations
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing features
- Proper error handling and user feedback throughout
