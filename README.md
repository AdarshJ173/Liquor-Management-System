## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/muneeswarreddy740-cpu/Liquor-Management-System.git
cd Liquor-Management-System
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Setup Convex Database

#### Login to Convex
```bash
npx convex login
```

#### Initialize Convex Development
```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will:
- Create a new Convex project
- Deploy your schema and functions
- Generate the client configuration
- Start the development server

### 4. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Convex Configuration
VITE_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url_here

# Owner Password (set this to a secure password)
CONVEX_OWNER_PASSWORD=your_secure_password_here
```

**Important**: Replace `your_secure_password_here` with a strong password. This will be used for protected operations like stock removal and transaction deletion.

### 5. Deploy to Convex

For production deployment:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

### 6. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will open in your browser at `http://localhost:5173`

### Adding New Features

1. **Backend Changes**:
   - Add new functions in the `convex/` directory
   - Update `convex/schema.ts` if new tables are needed
   - Deploy with `npx convex deploy`

2. **Frontend Changes**:
   - Update HTML structure in `index.html`
   - Add styles in `style.css`
   - Implement functionality in `app.js`

## Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

The frontend can be deployed to any static hosting service:

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `dist/` folder** to:
   - Vercel
   - Netlify
   - GitHub Pages
   - Firebase Hosting
   - Any web server

### Backend Deployment

Convex handles backend deployment automatically:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This deploys your schema and functions to Convex's global infrastructure.

## Backup Strategy

### Automatic Backups
Convex provides automatic backups on paid plans.

### Manual Backups
Export data manually:
```bash
npx convex export --path ./backup-$(date +%F).zip
```

### Scheduled Backups
Set up GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD for automated backups.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Convex Connection Error**:
   - Check your `VITE_CONVEX_URL` environment variable
   - Ensure Convex development server is running
   - Verify internet connection

2. **Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify `CONVEX_OWNER_PASSWORD` is set correctly
   - Check that the password matches what you're entering

3. **Build Errors**:
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
   - Clear cache: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json && npm install`

4. **Mobile Display Issues**:
   - The app is mobile-first, so it should work well on all devices
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by adding to your `.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_DEBUG=true
```
